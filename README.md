### Hi there, I'm Paul :)

I've got a personal webpage now! Check it out: [Paul's Particles](https://paulstapel.github.io)
\ 
I'm currently studying physics, mathematics and computer science. Besides that, I also manage my website, tutor and write (code). 
\
You can always ask me about my personal projects. I love to talk about how I study/work, my philosophy and cooking :)
\
You can always reach me with the following mail: dndpaul88@gmail.com. 
Sometimes, I even remember to check this inbox.
